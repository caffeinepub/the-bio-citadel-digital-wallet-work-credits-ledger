  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive error logging, error classification utilities, user-friendly error messages with toast notifications, and enhanced logging throughout the authentication flow. However, explicit verification of canister IDs and Identity Provider URLs in production builds is not directly evident in the diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Verify that the backend canister ID is correctly set in the frontend actor initialization and matches the deployed production canister",
      "reason": "While useActor.ts is mentioned in the file summaries as having enhanced logging and canister ID validation, the actual diff does not show the implementation of explicit canister ID verification or matching against the deployed production canister. The vite-env.d.ts adds type definitions for VITE_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID but does not demonstrate verification logic.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Check that the Internet Identity provider URL in useInternetIdentity.ts is correctly configured for the production Internet Computer network (not local replica)",
      "reason": "The file summary mentions automatic environment detection for Identity Provider URL but the actual code changes in useInternetIdentity.ts are not shown in the diff. Without seeing the implementation, we cannot verify that the URL points to https://identity.ic0.app for production or that localhost URLs are removed.",
